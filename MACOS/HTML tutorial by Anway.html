<h2><b><u>1.1.1 What is a Web Site?</b></u>
<h3>While discussing about technology,we have seen that the basic unit of information displayed over the net is a Web Page. Now,a website is a collection of Web Pages which were interlinked. The various webpages are prepared independently and in the end they are linked in the required sequence depending on the logical makeup of information on the site. Note that the link for a Web Page is basically a URL (Unifrom Resource Locator)that is the address of the computer where the page is present. Such a collection of related Web Pages is known as a WEB SITE.

<h3><b>The first page of a Web Site is meant for welcoming the reader who has logged on the reader who has logged on the site. Hence it is known at the HOME page. All sites necessarily have this page. Nevertheless, the design of it could change from site to site depending on the designer and the type of the site. For example, when the user login to the Microsoft Web Site its HOME page opens up which looks as shown in the Figure 2. The home page is like a menu card at a restaurant, which lists all the items available for us to order. Service depends on the order we give for an item, similarly HOME page provides labeled links to the main web pages. Option to navigate to a page can be indicated by clicking on the appropriate link provided in the HOME page.</b>
